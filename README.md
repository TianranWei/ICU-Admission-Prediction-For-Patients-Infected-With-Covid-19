# ICU-Admission-Prediction-For-Patients-Infected-With-Covid-19
## Abstract
Since the coronavirus outbreak in 2020, healthcare systems around the world have been suffering from extremely difficult situations as the epi- demic has intensified. ICU, or intensive care unit, as a critical part of the healthcare system, its capacity has been reached at a critical level in many countries. Given this situation, countries are taking various mea- sures to alleviate the ICU shortage, such as building new ICU units and urgently training new medical staff. Another way to alleviate the short- falls in ICU resources is to explore how medical resources can be allocated more appropriately. 

In this paper, anonymized clinical data from Hospital S ́ırio-Libanˆes, Sa ̃o Paulo and Brasilia are used and a data mining approach is practiced on it. Multiple supervised machine learning models including logistic regression, decision tree, support vector machine, naive Bayes, and artificial neutral network are developed to predict admission to the ICU of confirmed COVID-19 cases. This will greatly reduce the workload of medical staff, assist in decision-making in earlier stage, and increase the accuracy of medical judgments. The result of the performance evaluation of the models showed that random forest model has the highest accuracy of 94.5% while the Multi-layer Perceptron classifier has the accuracy of 92.2%.
